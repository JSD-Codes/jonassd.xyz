    <main><p>First, download the file <a href='Super_Fighter.py' download>here.</a> If you have have not downloaded one of my games before, also download <a href="pytilities.py" download>this</a> and keep it in the same folder.</p>
    <p>If IDLE is not already installed on your device, I reccomend reading <a href='https://coderivers.org/blog/python-download-idle/' target='_blank'>this article.</a></p>
    <p>Once you have IDLE installed, click on File > Open, then select super_fighter.py and click Run > Run Module. After that, enjoy the game!</p>
    <p>If you are an advanced user and want to run it in a different IDE, go ahead! Just don't use the terminal or a web based interpreter. it does not work as well.
